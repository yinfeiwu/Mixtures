#AUDREY  # Mixtures

EM_function_1.R -- contains code for the first EM algorithm to detect the mixture proportions given k groups

EM_function_2.R -- contains code for the second EM algorithm to detect which hidden ancestries are present

plots_mixtures_EM1.R -- contains code to plot output from EM_funtion_1.R -- note this code only plots for two ancestries - will need to update for three+

loop_submit.R -- contains an example script for submitting a batch of jobs via loops in R and BASH

Basic_submit.R -- contains an example script for submitting one job to the Linux cluster

snpsampgenR.R -- contains an R script to generate a simulated population using the correct MAF proportions -- note: need to set location of data, need to set parameters (otherwise randomized parameters), need to set location to write generated file
